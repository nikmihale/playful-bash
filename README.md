# playful-bash

Alarm, alarm2 - an attempt to turn one's laptop into an alarm clock, which would wake you up with a playlist from yandex music
  Doesn't work properly

xdetach, xdetach_h - a script to make use of an old tablet. 
Upon launching and clicking on a window, the window is resized and minimized before it begins being broadcasted over VNC. 
The idea behind this script was to use the tablet as a secondary monitor, which houses an arbitrary window.
  Kind of works

ss - I wondered how to work with compression and pipes in bash thus creating this script.
